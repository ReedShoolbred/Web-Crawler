Web-Crawler is intended solely as a demo application to implement a REST API and CRUD functionality in a Spring application. 

There is currently no REST controller or UI implementation, so funcionality is only accessible by downloading the source code and modifying the main application. 
Once the REST controller and UI are implemented, I will update this with a user guide. 

If you would like to purely test the webcrawling and/or database functionality though, you can do so by connecting your own database via the application.properties file.
